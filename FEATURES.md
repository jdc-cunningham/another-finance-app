What doesn't this do right now?

- [ ] show me the actual card cost with interest growth, just does min due right now

I can add that in with fixed values I got from previous statements

No... will add this to another view eg. debt growth, it's not really a bill although if you were trying to pay your stuff dwon you would consider interest growth

Or in my case trying to prevent going over my limit
