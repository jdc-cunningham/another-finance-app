Alright, back on, I have to achieve something today, for my weekend to not feel like a waste

Hopefully two things:

- this app
- RN app

Alright... got my coffee with hazelnut dry creamer (sweetened) and future funk let's go

right now I already have at least 3 credit cards over the limit, I'm in this cycle where I can't pay the balance down enough where the monthly interest doesn't go over the limit

I really wish I had my digital drawing tools... like remarkable or a tablet

I still have a kamvas pro graphics tablet but the angled drawing isn't great, I mostly use it as a second monitor
