### About

This pulls from a google spreadhseet using this [API](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/burn-rate/tree/master/api) I made for another finance related app.

Main purposes of this app:
- how much do I owe and when
- do I have enough to pay
- growth of cards

I have a spreadsheet where I log all my data say 5 times a month. I log into all my accounts/write them down. Then it gets filtered into something that tells me if I'm f'd or f'd which of course I am.
